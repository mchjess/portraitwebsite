#### Free photographic portraits! ####

This website has been created to house my submissions for the next National Portrait Gallery's Photographic Portrait Prize 2025.

I intend to ask members of the interested public to email me for a free professional photographic session in exchange for using their portraits in the next National Protrait Gallery's Photographic Portrait Prize and in exchange for a professional testimonial for my studio website once that's up and running. As a new photographer in my community and in the industry, I have a lot to learn and I don't feel comfortable charging people for my time at the moment. I can't quite justify the cost or the pressure to produce something I think was worth paying for.
